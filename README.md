# Galaxy Trucker: Odyssey
A free variant for the Galaxy Trucker boardgame that anyone can implement.

# Introduction
Galaxy Trucker is a fun game, but it tends to get stale for more experienced players. There is an optimal ship configuration which is relatively easy to build that will survive anything the game throws at you. Odyssey aims to make the game harder while staying true to the theme of Galaxy Trucker.

# Ship Building
* Only the class III ship layout is used in this variant (you can also choose to use class IIIa).
* For every round of ship building you only get one sandtimer's worth of time to build.
* When the sandtimer runs out, every player must stop building immediately.
* You may remove components from your ship.
* For round 2 and above, you build off the ship you ended with on the previous round.

# Tie Breaking
*All* ties are resolved the same way: highest roll goes first.

# The Journey
* Create a journey deck: Add all but 6 from the deck for the current round. Add 3 cards from each deck from previous rounds.
* Any number of players can occupy the same flight day. All players start on the first flight day.
* If a ship is without a main cabin, or its main cabin is unoccupied by a human, the ship cannot use batteries.
* If an alien occupies a main cabin, the alien's bonus is doubled.
* If a ship is without humans, its player cannot make decisions about any event.
* If a ship is without rocket power, it cannot land on planets or take off from the warehouse (forfiet).
* Components and crew lost through catastrophic events are set aside; **those resources cannot be used for the remainder of the game.**
* Red goods may be placed in regular cargo holds.
* If a regular cargo hold component containing a red good is hit and destroyed, the red good explodes and destroys the four adjacent orthogonal components (this cannot be avoided).


# Journey End
* All bonuses occur the same.
* All players may sell any goods on their ship for their full price, unless they have no crew remaining.
* **Do not clear your game board.** All players will begin the ship building phase with the same ship and build off of it.

# Game End
The games ends after the third round finishes. All players must pay 1 credit for each component and crew they lost. All players who have at least 1 credit win, but the richest player wins a bit more than everyone else.
