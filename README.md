# Galaxy Trucker: Odyssey
A free variant for the Galaxy Trucker boardgame that anyone can implement.

# Introduction
Galaxy Trucker is a fun game, but it tends to get stale for more experienced players. There is an optimal ship configuration which is relatively easy to build that will survive anything the game throws at you. Odyssey aims to make the game harder while staying true to the theme of Galaxy Trucker.

# Ship Building
* Only the class III ship layout is used in this variant (you can also choose to use class IIIa).
* For every round of ship building you only get one sandtimer's worth of time to build.
* When the sandtimer runs out, every must stop building immediately.
* You may remove components from your ship.
* For round 2 and above, you build off the ship you ended with on the previous round.

# The Journey
* Create a journey deck: Add all but 6 from the deck for the current round. Add 3 cards from each deck from previous rounds.
* Any number of players can occupy the same flight day. All players start on the first flight day.
* Order of events works the same, except for players on the same flight day. In this case, those players can agree who goes before the other, or they can roll for it (with the highest role going first, next highest goes second, etc.)
* If a ship is without a main cabin, or its main cabin is unoccupied, the ship cannot use batteries.
* If the ship is without humans, its player cannot make decisions about any event (for example, he cannot decide to land on planets, he cannot decide to fight off pirates, and he cannot use any rockets in open space).
* If any component or resource is lost through a catastrophic event (components getting blown off, smugglers, slavers, etc), those components and resources are placed next to the player's game board and can never be used by any player for the remainder of the game.

# Journey End
* All bonuses occur the same.
* All players may sell any goods on their ship for their full price, no matter the state of their ship.
* **Do not clear your game board!** You will begin the ship building phase with the same ship and build off of it.

# Game End
The games ends after the third round finishes. All players must pay 1 credit for each component they lost. All players who have at least 1 credit win, but the richest player wins a bit more than everyone else.
